what are the open source tools?
___________

some reasons why user chose open source tools.
-Far less proprietary conventions 
-usually able to use right away 
-if someone get stuck, broad community that can help him to understand what he need to do 
-i can make a small implementation on my own machine and expand from there
-any issue i find can become bug reports for the community to fix rather than "trouble tickets" for the vendor to ignore
