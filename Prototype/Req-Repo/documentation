	Install project dependencies:
	Run the following commands from the project root directory.
		$ npm install
		$ bower install 

Commands to run:
	$ grunt build (builds the source and generates the min files in dist).
	$ grunt serve (runs a local web server on node.js).
	$ grunt test (runs the tests).
	$ grunt test:continuous (ens to ens test).

     Flexbox allows the content area to resize to fit the remaining

Implementation Details:
    Uses angulare/native JS for Sortable and draggable.
    No JQuerry UI used in the interface.
    Provides callbacks for drag and drop events.
    
Sorting/Horizontal drag and drop 
    can be achieved using the same library. The column display can be
    tweaked to have horizontal items and the same can be achieved via 
    some CSS tweaks ( like making the column display style to "inline-
    block").
