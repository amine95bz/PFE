requirement development 
	- Elicitation : in this part we should try to understand what sort of requirements may arise, identify the requirement, collection and discovery process    
	- Analyzed : understanding the requirement in different forms.
	- Specification : in this part we should communicate to the other stakeholders   
	- Validation : to determent that the requirement are correct, hight quality, and what user need 
		=> It should the co-presence of the person involved 
requirement is the perform of the project 
two types of requirement 
	- Non-functional 
	- Functional : 
			- Web develop 
			- Software 
			=> Interaction between the system and it envirnment 
****** The requirement must be changeable during the project ******
==>the requirement must have a clearly state of all the Non functional and functional requirement 
	+ The requirement used for 
		- To provide visual examples to clients 
		- To buffer time for each activity 
		-

***** Requirement management :

Goal: first thing creating a baseline it means the foundation of the project, specific product release.  
manage the version of requirement documents 
change control process 
impact analysis to understand how to make a change for someone request 
attributes
status 
trace requirement into designs, code, tests and documentation

***** A good requirement *****

	- A good requirement must be always updated 
	- Before every new requirement you should make a quality test, (your requirement should response to all the question)
	- Each requirement should be understandable and usable by the customer to say it s a good requirement 
	- A good requirement should get important steps  (Characteristics of a good requirement) 
		-Quality characteristics 
		-cohesiveness
		-completeness 
		-consistency 
		-correctness
		-currency 
		-customer/user orientation 
		-external observability
		-feasibility 
		-lack of ambiguity
		-mandatory
		-metadata
		-relevance 
		-usability 
		-validatability 
		-verifiability 
	==> Hopefully by now, it is clear that specifying requirements of high quality is not trivial.
	    learning a few simple characteristics of hight quality requirements. (tout les etapes pour faire un bon plan de charge )

Different types of requirement 
- (BRD) : Business requirement => the business or the project goals (1st Step)
		- Sponsor/client  Goals
		- Scope of the project 
		- Business objectives   
- (FRD) : Functional requirement =>  fonctionality of the software detail (3rd step)
- (MRD) : Market requirement => focus into the market needs (2nd step)
- (PRD) : Product requirement => the same content of the FRD + the non-fonctional requirement (4th step)
- (UIRD): it's about the interface requirement
	  - also it content user requirement 
		- User goal 
		- User point of view 	
		- User output and input  

		+Requirement Gathering 
==>  The developers discuss with the client and end users and know their expectations from the software.
		+ Crowdsourcing 
- it s a group of people (non-technique) collaborated to complete a task in a project.
- the work in the same time (parallel) and in a different place.
	- Empower of the team

- they have the same condition as the crowdsourcing. 
- they have their own platform .
- they only send information to the server. 
- they don t have the permission to update s.th. 

		+Environment development 
-they work on two types of platforms 
	+ Online "online community" a part in touch with another such as buyer and seller, a collaborative work in the platform all the group work together in the same time.
	+ Offline an indirect way to work.
- exchange of the information between the server and the Env Dev.

Agile software 
	=> 4 important values for agile software 
		- Team 
		- The application 
		- Collaboration 
		- Changement agree 

Agile principles 
	- Costumer satisfaction (satisfaction de client) 	
	- Welcome changing requirement (accueillir les demandes de changement)
	- Working software (livraison)
	- Cooperation between buisiness people and developers (cooperation entre le client et l'équipe de projet)
	- Motivation 
	- Face to face conversation (pour bien comprendre les principes de projet) 
	- Working the software in the principale mesure of progress (il faut que l'avancement de projet sera bien fait) 
	- technical excellence and good design 
	- Simplicity of the project 
	- Empower of the team

Version control: 
offers many advantages 
	-You can control others work in the same project 
	-it allows you to revert files back to a previous state or you can revert all the project to a previous state 
	-it allows you to compare all the work/ compare changes 
	****** there s three types of version control local, central and distributed VCS 
		- local VCS : you work in the same computer but in another directory 
		- Central VCS : two persons work in their machines and everyone of them put his version in a server 
		- Distributed VCS : two computer have a link between them and everyone of the have a link with the server

-change management  

=>|      Change management is moving your organisation/ project from own current states to own future states.
  |	 also change management means change in some details " Processes, systems, organization structure and job roles "		
 
  |      It means also sharing the documents with all the stakeholders, collaborate the work in the real time, make a branch for each individual work 
  |	 and finally merging the work for combining the best solution.  

if you want to make a change management, first thing you should folow these steps 
	
	first step in any change acknowleging and understanding the need for change, for example you see something needs fixing 

	second step you should comunicate with those who working with you to explored the situation and fully understand what needs to make. The communication with stakeholders framework gives you many idea to resolve the probleme or to ameliorate the system 
	
	third step if you really start thinking about change, it means that you have a great idea that makes your situation better than the older and many other solutions floating around you. A clear vision and a good idea can help you and help everyone who wants to amelioratefirst step in any change acknowleging and understanding the need for change, for example you see something needs fixing 
 

	4th  step if you really start thinking about change, it means that you have a great idea that makes your situation better than the older and many other solutions floating around you. A clear vision and a good idea can help you and help everyone who wants to ameliorate. So in this step you should determine all the values that are really need a change. develop a shot paragraph to explane what you see as a future of your project besides you should execute this vision with creating a strategy. 

	5th step you should recomunicate with your stakeholders to make the right decisions and slove all the probleme. this step allows you to remove all the obstacles and reach your goals. 
	
	6th step look for something that are not expensive that make you able to justify the investiment in each project 
after all that you should evaluate the progress, in this time if all going well you can celebrate success and if something wrong you can review your change and check you idea again with you stakeholders and fix the error if that possible.

About Onshape 

===> Onshape is an application focused on cloud. who offer a professional 3D computer aided design system that can help anyone on  design. This application allows the team to work together using any web browser or mobile application.

	Onshape helps the users to make a better design, also onshape has many features like  real time deployment, real time data management, real time change management, real time analyse and controls by using the cloud. 
	
	Onshape gives to the user the permission to share the document with someone who didn't have an account, in this time you can add what you want to work with you in the same document, you can choose what he can do 'edit, read or share' and also you can remove the access to the contact.
	
	Onshape is designed to be more reliable than standard software systems, such as those who didn't work in a parallel way.

	Us a result of cooperation you can find too many versions of work in many branches in your document, that helps you to choose the right branche to ameliorate your document.
	
	After choosing the right branche you can synchronize the work  
	
	If the project has many tasks and everyone has his own task, after finishing the work onshape allows the users to collect all the branches and make them in the same document 
	
	Many users working in the same document at the same time is referred to collaboration of the work. Any and all the features added or changed mmade displayed in real time to all the users in the project.
	
	User collaborating in the same document/project allows you to control what another user is doing in real time (FOLLOW MODE) 
	
	Real time data management is the information that is delivered immediately after collection. 

	Is created to solve the traditional management problems, which allows you to combines both functions. this step is one of the key benefits provided by onshape. 

	onshape have also an online version and offline version 
		the online version work on browser or mobile application 

		and the offline version it s against agile method, it makes you to work in your document but not in the real time. 
		
	Real time change management is the same meaning as change management in a general way, but this one has an extra meaning that it is executed in a short time.
