Requirement:

		=> It should the co-presence of the person involved 
requirement is the perform of the project 
two types of requirement 
	- Non-fonctional 
	- Fonctional : 
			- Web develop

			=> Interaction between the systeme and it envirement 
==>the requirement must have a clearly state of all the Non fonctional and fonctional requirement 
	+ The requirement used for 
		- To provide visual examples to clients 
		- To buffer time for each activity 
		-

- (BRD) : Business requirement => the business or the project goals (1st Step)
		- Sponsor/client  Goals
		- Scope of the project 
		- Business objectif   
- (FRD) : Functional requirement =>  fonctionality of the software detail (3rd step)
- (MRD) : Market requirement => focus into the market needs (2nd step)
- (PRD) : Product requirement => the same content of the FRD + the non-fonctional requirement (4th step)
- (UIRD): it's about the interface requirement
